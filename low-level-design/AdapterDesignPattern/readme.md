Your team is integrating a third-party payment gateway into your e-commerce system.

Your system expects a PaymentProcessor interface with a method pay(amount).

However, the third-party library provides a StripeSDK class with a different method: makePayment(int valueInCents).

You need to integrate the SDK without changing your existing codebase.

How would you use the Adapter Pattern to make this integration smooth?

What are real-world examples of Adapter pattern?

Javaâ€™s InputStreamReader adapts InputStream to Reader

Adapters in Spring's HandlerAdapter to match controller method signatures
