You're building a Music Streaming App (like Spotify). Each user can create multiple playlists, and each playlist contains songs from different genres.

Now you need to support a feature where:

ðŸ”¹ Design the playlist module such that the client can iterate over songs without exposing the internal structure of the playlist.
